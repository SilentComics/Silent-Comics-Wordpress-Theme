# Silent Comics WordPress Theme

*SilentComics* is a WordPress theme designed for the upcoming [SILENT COMICS site](http://silent-comics.com). The theme, still in development, is released under the GNU General Public License.

## Code review needed
Coding is the *learning by doing* side of the project for me. I'm by no means a WordPress developer and there are countless improvements to be made. 

Do you know how to improve this theme? Please send your findings and suggestions over to hoa // @ // silent-comics.com

## Other ways you can help:
Theme review aside, there are a few other ways you can [support this project â™¥](http://silentcomics.com/subscribe/). *Thank you!*
