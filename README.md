WIP WordPress-Theme-for-Silent-Comics
=================================

Not ready for production yet, but you are welcome to test the theme. Right now it has two functions (custom post type and taxonomies) that belong to a plugin. **Warning** It means you will lose access to the comics data when changing theme.
