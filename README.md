WIP WordPress Theme for Silent-Comics
=================================

*SilentComics* is a WordPress theme designed for the upcoming [SILENT COMICS site](http://silent-comics.com). It is still in development.

As such, this theme is not 100% ready for production yet, but you are welcome to test it. Right now two of the theme's functions, *custom post type* and *custom taxonomy*, should go in a plugin. WordPress.org advocates for the separation of presentation and content<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>. This is important for portability of content. Yet for this particular project, using custom functions within the theme makes sense too<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>. The theme design responds to the projects needs. **Warning** :loudspeaker: But it means you will lose access to your (comics) data if you use this theme and then switch theme. That is not something we want to happen. So until a [simple webcomic plugin](https://github.com/SilentComics/strip-plugin) is ready to solve this potential issue, it is best to avoid using this theme on your live site.
