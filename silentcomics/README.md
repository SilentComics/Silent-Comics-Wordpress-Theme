# Silent Comics Wordpress Theme

This is SilentComics — a simple Wordpress theme, designed for the upcoming [SILENT COMICS site](http://silent-comics.com). The theme, still in development, is released on GNU General Public License.

This theme aims to be a simple to use receptacle for online comics. Responsive and distraction-free to display large images and galleries desktop computers, mobile and tablets. Its main function is a comic post format with basic navigation for comics. Non obtrusive commenting. Ideal for large images, galleries and continuous stories. Display comic pages in ascending or descending order (scroll) or one panel at a time, as a WP gallery in one post (card). In this logic, the theme can read a story panel by panel or page by page. Multiple stories: the theme enables series or one-off stories thanks to the custom taxonomy “story”. If no category is set for a comic story, the comic post will default to “draft”. One column blog with simple typography, supporting post-formats (e.g. video, audio,…). Three columns footer widget, no sidebars.
