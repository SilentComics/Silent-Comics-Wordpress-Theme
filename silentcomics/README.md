# Silent Comics WordPress Theme

This is SilentComics — a simple WordPress theme, designed for the upcoming [SILENT COMICS site](http://silent-comics.com). The theme, still in development, is released under the GNU General Public License.

## About
This theme aims to be a receptacle for online comics. Simple to use, distraction free, responsive. Designed to display large image, galleries and continuous stories on desktop computers, mobile and tablets. Its main function is a comic post format with basic navigation for comics. Comics display in ascending or descending order (scroll) or one panel at a time, as a WP gallery in one post (card). In this logic, each story reads panel by panel or page by page. The theme will handle different series or one-off stories thanks to the custom taxonomy “story”. When no category is set for a comic story, the comic post will default to “draft”. The blog features are single column, simple typography, and post-formats (video, galleries, etc.). Non obtrusive commenting (toggle on & off). Four columns footer widget, no sidebars.
